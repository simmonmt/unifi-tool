# `unifi_tool`

This is a Go-based tool used for manipulating Unifi controllers. It implements
a subset of the supported and unsupported parts of the API. The supported part
is documented in http://dl.ubnt.com/unifi/X.X.X/unifi_sh_api. The unsupported
part was derived by 
[this project](https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-client). This project
started as "I'd like a command-line interface to the controller, but I don't
want to use PHP".
